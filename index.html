            About:
            <br><br>I am currently working as a Computer Scientist for Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) under the Air Traffic Control & Landing Systems (ATCL&S). Primary work has been on the acquisition, development, and testing of various Department of Defense systems related to safety of flight. Rigorous software engineering is required to ensure our service members have reliable systems to accomplish their mission. My passion is continuous learning and constant improvement of software skills while providing meaningful products to the customer.
